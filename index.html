            <h3>QA Automation Co-op</h3>
            <p><strong>Commonwealth Financial Network</strong> | QA Automation Team</p>
            <p>As a member of the QA Automation team, I developed and maintained automated testing frameworks to improve the efficiency and reliability of the software development process. I created and executed test scripts, identified bugs, and collaborated closely with developers to ensure high-quality releases. My work focused on streamlining testing procedures and enhancing the overall quality assurance process through automation.</p>

            <h3>Software Engineering Co-op</h3>
            <p><strong>CNC Software LLC</strong> | Art and Simulation Team</p>
            <p>As a Software Engineer on the Art and Simulation team, I contributed to enhancing the user interface for simulation previews, improving the overall user experience. I optimized modeling performance through C++ multi-threading, significantly increasing efficiency and reducing processing time. Additionally, I worked on updating legacy code and collaborated with the team using Agile and Scrum methodologies to ensure seamless software delivery for CNC machine simulation visualization.</p>

            <h3>Brain Hemorrhage CNN</h3>
            <p>With my team, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting brain hemorrhages from CT scan images. The model was designed to accurately identify and classify hemorrhages, assisting in early diagnosis and improving clinical decision-making. My work included model building/training, data preprocessing, and performance tuning to ensure high accuracy and reliability in medical applications.</p>

            <h3>Qthreads /h3>
            <p>I developed a custom User-space POSIX-like thread to explore concurrency and parallelism in a complex software system. This custom thread was built using C and assemlby, following a cooperative threading model. The process provided valuable insights into thread management, allowing for explorations into concurrency and stack managment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>Unix-like Shell</h3>
            <p>Developed a Unix-like command-line shell in C, implementing key features for interactive user experience and system process control. Built a command parser to interpret user input, enabling the execution of system and built-in shell commands. Incorporated process management capabilities, including forking, waiting, and handling child processes, which facilitated both background and foreground execution. Implemented I/O redirection and piping functionality. </p>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>Simulation Calculation Optimization</h3>
            <p>I built an optimized multi-threaded simulation function using C++ for CNC machine models, achieving a 25% improvement in runtime performance. This optimization enhanced the efficiency of the simulation process, allowing for faster model previews and better resource utilization. The engine's improved performance contributed to more accurate and timely results for CNC machining simulations.</p>
